    message: "Backend API testing completed successfully. 22/24 tests passed (91.7% success rate). Core functionality working well. Minor issues: 1) One cosine similarity test fails due to NaN values in JSON serialization - this is a data quality issue, not core functionality failure. 2) CORS headers not exposed in OPTIONS requests - minor configuration issue. All critical endpoints (health, similarity analysis, database stats, methods) are working correctly with proper error handling and performance under 2 seconds."
